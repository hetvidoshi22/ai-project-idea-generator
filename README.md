# AI Project Idea Generator 🚀

An AI-powered web application that helps students and developers discover meaningful, skill-aligned project ideas.

Choosing the right project is often harder than building one. Many available suggestions are either too generic, too ambitious, or not aligned with a person’s career direction. This system aims to provide structured and realistic project ideas based on a user’s experience level, preferred domain, and goals.

The focus of this project is not just idea generation, but building a complete engineering system around AI — including backend design, prompt structuring, response validation, and clean frontend interaction.
